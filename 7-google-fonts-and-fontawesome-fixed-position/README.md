# Google Fonts and Font Awesome

Designers and Developers create new fonts and submit to Google fonts to share their work.  You can use these fonts for free.  Fontawesome provides fonts that render as icons.  A large subset of the Fontawesome fonts are available for free.

We often want to supply a set of links that are accessbible in a fixed position on the web page. This is different than absolution position, which is relative to a container.  With fixed position, we choose a location relative to an edge of the whole window and fix are items there.  

In this exercise, you'll add 2 google fonts and 1 fontawesome icon to your page.  You'll fix the icon to top right side of the page.
